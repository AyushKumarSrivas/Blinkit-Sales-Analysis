# Blinkit-Sales-Analysis
Blinkit Sales Analysis is a Python-based Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project focused on uncovering sales trends, customer behavior, and outlet-level performance from Blinkit’s sales dataset. The project demonstrates strong skills in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using industry-standard Python libraries.
🎯 Business Problem

Blinkit requires data-driven insights to:

Understand sales performance across products and outlets

Identify high-revenue categories and underperforming segments

Analyze customer preferences and satisfaction trends

Support strategic decisions in inventory and outlet management

🧰 Tech Stack 

Python

Pandas – Data cleaning, transformation, aggregation

NumPy – Numerical and statistical operations

Matplotlib – Core data visualizations

Seaborn – Advanced and statistical plots

Jupyter Notebook – Interactive EDA workflow

📊 KPIs & Metrics Analyzed

Total Sales – Overall revenue generated

Average Sales – Mean revenue per item

Number of Items Sold – Product volume analysis

Average Rating – Customer satisfaction measurement

🔍 EDA Workflow
1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handled missing values and inconsistent data

Corrected data types and standardized categorical values

Removed duplicates and ensured data quality

2️⃣ Univariate Analysis

Distribution analysis of sales, ratings, and item visibility

Frequency analysis of item types and outlet characteristics

3️⃣ Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis

Sales vs Fat Content

Sales vs Item Type

Sales vs Outlet Size, Location, and Establishment Year

Ratings vs Sales

📈 Visualizations

The following visualizations were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn:

Bar Charts

Pie Charts

Line Charts

Box Plots

Count Plots

Distribution Plots

Each visualization supports insight discovery and business interpretation.
